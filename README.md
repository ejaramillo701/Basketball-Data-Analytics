# Basketball-Data-Analytics
A few personal projects applying DS100 material to the NBA.

1. The Lonzo EDA file is a notebook which explores Lonzo Ball's shooting this season using data pulled from basketball-reference.com. Some of the skills from the course used here included requests/ web-scraping, regular expressions, plotting with matplot.lib and seaborn, and some basic pandas manipulations.

2. Homecourt Adv. Prob simulator is a notebook simulating the odds that a team wins a series under two different formats. It is an interesting example of the central limit theorem and how to construct Bernoulli p-trials. 

3. Game simulator data prep is a notebook which explains how to extract NBA game data, again from basketball-reference.com, and extract some interesting features that we could feed into a model that predicts game outcomes. It is another example of how to scrape data from the web and how to use some more advanced pandas manipulations to extract interesting features.
